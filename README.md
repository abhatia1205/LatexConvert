# LatexConvert

This was a project we built during a 24 hours hackathon. I am a lover of math, but one of the issues I face is writing math in Latex ... it's really tedious. i wanted a way to write handwritten equations in a web app, and it wouldn't convert the handwritten digits and synbols into a LaTex equation. The frontend user interface and the backend Flask framework was written by my friend, Micahel Yang, and the python scripts and app.py was written by myself. I also created a neural network that takes in an image of an equation as an input and outputs a list of characters that it recognizes. The neural network wasn't extremely great as the input data I had was rather sparse, but it was a good effort for a 24 hour hackathon. 90% of the rpoject is done, but we had problems reliably sending images from the UI thoguh the Flask framework to the Python scripts, and thus, it doesn't work terribly well right now (alhtough both the UI and the model are fully functional).
